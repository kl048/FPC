            <b>Instructions</b>
        </p>
    This is an experiment in the economics of market decision making.
    The instructions are simple, and if you follow them carefully and make good decisions you may earn a
    <b>CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY</b>
    which will be <b>PAID TO YOU IN CASH </b>at the end of the experiment.
    <p>
    <hr>
        <p>
            <b>Markets</b>
        </p>
    In this experiment, you will act as part of a firm which is in a market with another firm for <b>50 periods </b>.
    You must decide the price at which your firm will sell units of a fictitious commodity.
    <p>
    </p>
        <p>
        During the 50 periods, the other firm in your market will always be the same.
        That is, though there are a number of participants in the room, you and the same other firm serve your market
        for the entire course of the experiment. The other participants serve other markets.
        </p>
    <p>

During the entire experiment, your firm will play the role of a <b> Firm A or a Firm B </b>.

    </p>

    <p>
    The trade of the commodity determines your profit in <b>Experimental Currency Units (ECUs)</b>.
        In what follows, we explain how sales in the market are made and
        how your profit is computed.
        Before we start with the actual experiment, we will ask you a few questions to review these instructions and ensure everybody has fully understood them.
        Then we will begin the first trading period.
    </p>

        <b>Firms</b>
     </p>
    <p>
    In every period, you will be paired with another subject, and the two of you will act as a firm.
        You will each be assigned a unique ID, and you will be able to discuss pricing strategy with your teammate using a chat box.
        Only you and your teammate will be able to see the messages sent within your firm.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <b>first two periods</b>, you will have <b>3 minutes </b> to communicate with your teammate and enter the price for your firm.
        Starting from the <b>third period </b>, you will have <b>60 seconds</b> to communicate about prices.
        You are allowed to post as many messages as you like. There are only two restrictions on messages:
        you may not post messages which identify yourself (e.g., age, gender, location etc.),
        and you may not use offensive language.
        You should use the time to discuss what price you would like to set as a firm.
    </p>
    <p>
        <hr>
        <b>How sales are done:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    In every period, you and the other firm in the market choose a price at which to sell units of the commodity.
        Note that this is the price per unit. While you may sell more than one unit, you can post only one price.
        That is, you cannot sell different units at different prices. Prices must be integers.
        The number of units you offer is automatically chosen by the computer in a way that ensures that you do not lose
        money by selling at a price below your production cost.
        </p>
    <p>
        If you and your teammate do not agree on a price before your time is up and select two different prices,
        the computer will randomly select one of the prices chosen. If neither of you enters a price,
        the computer will select a price at random.
        If one of you has chosen a price but the other has not, the computer will select the chosen price.
    </p>
    <p>
        <hr>
    <b>How purchases are done:</b>
        </p>
    <p>
        No buyers participate in this experiment. Instead, buyers are simulated by the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <hr>
    <b>Profit:</b>
        </p>
    <p>
        For every unit you sell, you earn the difference between your price and production cost for that unit.
        Profit in each period is the sum of these earnings.
        You will be able to see your profit and cumulative profit after the end of each period.
    </p>
    <p>
        <hr>
            <b>How to submit a price:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        When making pricing decisions, enter your price in the <b>“Please enter your price.”</b> box.
        You then have the option of using the built-in calculator to view potential profits.
        To use the calculator, <b>enter (in the other box) your guess as to what price the other seller will charge.</b>
        The software will display profits for the combination of your price and that of the other seller that you have entered.
        You can use the calculator for any number of price combinations. When you are ready to submit your price, press the “Submit Price” button.
        You also can skip doing calculations and click “Submit Price.”
    </p>
    <p>
        As noted before, you will have <b>three minutes </b> in the first two periods and <b>sixty seconds </b>on the remaining periods
        to discuss and select a price. In periods with three minutes to make price decisions, you will be able to
        submit your price decision by clicking on “Submit Price” only after <b>90 seconds,</b> and for the rest of the periods,
        you will be able to submit your price decision after <b>30 seconds </b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    <hr>
        <b>Profit tables:</b>
        <p>
            You will see a couple of versions of profit tables on your screen in the decision-making page.
            These tables provide the same information as the calculator, i.e., the calculator just displays a specific cell in the table.
            The tables show how your profit for a period relates to both your price choice and the price choice of the other seller overall.
        </p>

        .blue-text {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
    </style>
</head>
    <p>
        To see the full table, you can click on <span class="blue-text">“Click to see the FULL PROFIT TABLE.” </span>
        As you will see later, your price choices of 21 and above are shown on the left edge of the table from top to bottom.
        The other seller’s price choices of 21 and above are shown on the top of the table from left to right.
        Each cell in the table shows profits for the particular combination of prices. Your profit is the first number in the cell.
        The other seller’s profit is the second number after the comma.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose a price of 21 or below, your profit does not depend on the action of the other firm.
    </p>
    <p>
    To see the profit tables clear and large, please hover your mouse over the image with the table. You should be able to read the tables clearly after that.

       <b>Feedback:</b>
        </p>
    <p>
        At the end of each period, you will see a screen informing you about the price your firm charged and your resulting profit.
        You will see this same information for the other firm as well. In addition, you will see your cumulative profits.
    </p>
    <p>Later in the experiment, you will exchange one person from your firm for one person from another firm.
        That is, one person will leave your firm for the other firm in the market, and a new person from the other firm will join your firm.
        Before your teammate changes, you will be notified a few periods in advance and given further instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the end of the experiment, you will be told of the sum of profits made during the experiment, which will be your payment.
        Suppose your firm makes a profit of 2,000 ECUs, that means both the employees in your firm will get 2,000 ECUs each.
        You will receive <b>$1 for every 140 ECUs </b> you earn during the experiment. You will also receive <b> $7 </b> for participating in the experiment.
